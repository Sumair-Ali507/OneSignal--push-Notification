# OneSignal--push-Notification
# OneSignal Push Notification is a service that allows you to send notifications to users of your mobile app, helping you engage and retain them through timely and personalized messages. By integrating OneSignal into your Flutter project, you can easily send push notifications, segment your audience, and track user engagement.

# In my Flutter project, the OneSignal SDK has been added to handle push notifications. This setup enables you to:

# Send Notifications: You can send push notifications from the OneSignal dashboard, which will be delivered directly to your app users.
# Receive Notifications: Users will receive these notifications even when the app is in the background or closed, thanks to the integration of OneSignal's background notification handling.
# Customize Notification Handling: The integration allows you to manage notification behaviors, such as displaying custom alerts or directing users to specific pages within the app when a notification is clicked.
# Track User Activity: With OneSignal, you can track how users interact with notifications and gain insights into user engagement patterns.
# Overall, this integration helps to create a better communication channel with your app users, enhancing user retention and engagement with the content and services you provide
